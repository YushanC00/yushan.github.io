Quick Recreated Projects
These are projects that I've recreated based on my interview experiences. While I didn't succeed in those interviews, I still find value in attempting to recreate these projects in my own time. It's a way for me to demonstrate to myself that I can successfully complete these projects.

Challenges
CountdownClock

For this project, I challenged myself to recreate a CountdownClock component within just one hour. While I'm not very proficient in pair programming, I took on the task. Admittedly, I ended up feeling a bit nervous during the process, and as a result, I overlooked including some of the hooks I intended to use, such as useContext, and useRef. Additionally, I acknowledge that I didn't strictly adhere to best practices.
